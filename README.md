- 👋 Hi, I’m @Honestabe9 or @Ablrssm9
- 👀 I’m interested in trying to leverage any bit of CS knowledge to get into the space of imaging and its modalities for applications in biomedicine.
- 🌱 I’m currently interested in researching what programming languages learn: whether it be Python, C++, Java, JS, Objective-C/Swift, etc. And, to start applying them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects related to these avenues with implications to digital electronics, biotech and the like.
- 📫 How to reach me — here... LOL!
