• 👋 Hi, I’m @Honestabe9 or @Ablrssm9

• 👀 I’m interested in trying to leverage any bit of CS knowledge to get into the space of imaging and its modalities for applications in biomedicine.

• 🌱 I’m currently interested in researching what programming languages to learn/relearn: whether it be Python, C++, Java, JS, Objective-C/Swift, etc. And, to start applying them.

• 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects related to these avenues with implications to digital electronics, IoE, image/signal processing (for any field), biotech, machine learning, and the like.

• 📫 How to reach me — just visit here... LOL!
